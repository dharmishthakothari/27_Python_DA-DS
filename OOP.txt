OOP - Object Oriented Programming 
	
	prodecure oriented - each in term of procedure only
	Ojected oriented - each in term of object 

python - support OOP

Concept/features must be supported by language

	1. class
	2. Object
	3. Inheritance
	4. Encapsulation
	5. Polymorphisum
	6. Abstraction

1. class - blueprint of object
	 - collection object
	 - data members and member function
	Human  
	Person 	 - name,c_number,address,b_group	
		   getDetails(), display()
	Car
	
 SELF - current instance/object

2. object - it's is instance of class
		-real entity 
	- dharmishtha , pooja
	-Bhavesh , priyam
	-bmw ,

constructor - to initlize object
	getDetails() - remove this 
	
Vehical - brand , model_year
	
3. inheritance
	Parent - child 
	property of one class can use another class
	reusability

	Person name,c_no,address
	Employee - department,salary
	Manager - managerial_task

	Manager is employee and employee is person
	
	employee is person

	employee has name,c_no_address and salary
	
	Person doesn't have deparment/salary
